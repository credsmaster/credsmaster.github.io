### *Life is Negotiation*

The first step in achieving a mastery of daily negotiation is to get over your aversion to negotiating.  

#### Tactics / Techniques

1. Open ended questions/ calibrated questions - queries that the other party can answer but have no fixed answers --> Buys you time and gives the opponent a false idea of control
2. Based on Kahneman's research - 'Thinking, fast and slow', Influencing the subconscious mind(System 1 - fast, instinctive and emotional), gifts you control on the conscious mind (System 2 - the slow, deliberative and logical)
3. A way of seeding more warmth into an interaction(especially a tense situation) - use an apology and mention the name of the other party. i.e 'I am sorry John, but I cannot offer you that'.

#### Vocabularies

1. Languid (my counterpart was a languid guy) --> unenergetic, slow, relaxed
2. redhead (do not be a redhead) --> could be associated with having red hair or in slang, being a witch.
3. Smiling like the Cheshire cat --> a very wide smile
4. Haggle --> bargain persistently
5. Inchoate --> only recently
6. feet-to-the-fire --> to pressure someone to do something or simply to force someone to comply.
7. Muck up --> to spoil something completely or to do something badly that you fail to achieve what you anticipated.
8. schizophrenia - listening to the voices in the head

#### Great Minds Research Nuggets

Getting to Yes principles

1. Separate the person(the emotion) from the problem
2. Don't get wrapped up in the other side's position(what they are asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they are asking for it - know why they want it)
3. Work cooperatively to generate win-win options
4. Establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions

Tversky & Kahneman Research (Thinking, Fast and Slow)

* Framing effect -  demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed
* Prospect theory - explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses
* Loss Aversion - shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain

Psychotherapy research / Techniques

* Listening is the cheapest and yet the most effective concession - it demonstrates empathy and sincere desire to better understand what other side is experiencing
* Tactical Empathy --> Listening as a martial art i.e. balancing the subtle behavior of emotional intelligence and assertive skills of influence

Common Mistakes

* Schizophrenia - the condition where one is listening to the voices in their head
How to deal with it:
    Instead of prioritizing your argument(what to say), make your sole and all-encompassing focus on the other person and what they have to say
* Going too fast - in a negotiation, this risks undermining the rapport and trust.
