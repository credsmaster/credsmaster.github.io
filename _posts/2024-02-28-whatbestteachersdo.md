Teaching is a profession. While it takes some training to become a teacher, not all trained teachers are the best but only a few are. So, what does it take to be described as 'Best'. This book reviews some of the best college teachers and how they do what they do.

The best teachers have:

* Knowledge of the discipline at hand
* Keen sense of the histories of their disciplines - this leads to metacognition(ability to think about their own thinking)`

A survey was done and below are the key concepts from the survey

1. Knowledge is constructed, Not Received

- We construct our sense of reality out of all the sensory inputs we receive
- We use our existing mental models to shape the sensory inputs we receive
  
2. Mental Models Change Slowly

- To stimulate students to build new models, they must:
    
    * face a situation in which their mental model will not work
	* care that their mental model doesn't work, strongly enough to stop and grapple with the issue at hand
	* be able to handle the emotional trauma that sometimes accompanies challenges to longstanding beliefs

3. Students may find so much emotional comfort in some existing model of reality. To get them out of this;

* Ask questions that help students see their own mistakes
* Students must first know the basic facts of the discipline to be able to think, analyze, synthesize and make judgements
* Make the students see why they need to remember some piece of information and why some certain facts drives the understanding`
