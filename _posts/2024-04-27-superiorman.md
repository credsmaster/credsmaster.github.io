Sexual attraction is based on sexual polarity  
Sexual polarity is the force of passion that arcs between masculine and feminine poles creating a sexual feeling  
Each of us possess some inner masculine and feminine qualities  
For sexual polarity, you need an energetic polarity i.e. an attractive difference between masculine and feminine  
The search for freedom is the priority for masculine while the search for love is the priority for feminine  
For Masculine, mission, competition are all form of ecstasy  
The desire for love is what appears in feminine forms of entertainment  
The masculine wants to feel the bliss of life at the edge - that is why men are into sports, action movies and such

### A man's way

#### Stop Hoping for a completion of anything in life

- Spend a minimum of one hour day doing what you love to do - what you feel you need to do
- Limited time and family obligations have never stopped a man who really wanted to do something, they provide excuses for a man who is not really up to to the creative challenge
- Every moment waited is a moment wasted, and each wasted moment degrades your clarity of purpose

#### Live with an open heart even if it hurts

A superior man is free in feeling and action, even amidst great pain and hurt. If necessary, a man should live with a hurting heart rather than a closed one

#### Know your real edge and don't fake it

The more a man is playing his real edge, the more valuable he is 
Your edge is where you stop short or where you compromise your fullest gift
The point here is to be aware and embrace your fears, living at the edge and putting out your gift from there

#### Always Hold To your Deepest Realization

Make your life an ongoing process of being who you are, at your deepest, most easeful levels of being. Everything other than this process is secondary.
Read books that remind you of who you are, in truth.

#### Never Change Your Mind Just to Please a Woman

If a woman suggests something that changes a man’s perspective, then he should make a new decision based on his new perspective. 
But he should never betray his own deepest knowledge and intuition in order to please his woman or “go along” with her. Both she and he will be weakened by such an action. They will grow to resent each other, and the crust of accumulated inauthenticity will burden their love, as well as their capacity for free action.
