## Cut Your Cord  
This sermon is inspired by how a baby is fed. When in the womb, the baby feeds through the umbilical cord. After 9 months, the baby changes the environment and so does the feeding system. First, the channel through which the baby was feeding is cut.  

We can relate with this closely as believers and Christians. When we come into salvation, we need to give away old habits, old feeding systems and accept new ones. Ideally we need to subject ourselves or feed from a different altar.
