# FACTS
_BALAAM’S THIRD DISCOURSE CONTINUED (24:1-13):_  
- Chapter 24 opens in the middle of Balak’s third attempt. 

- Balak built 7 altars and sacrificed 7 rams and 7 bulls (23:29-30). When this was complete, the Spirit of God came on Balaam and he began his 3rd discourse, a 3rd consecutive blessing for the Israelites. 

- He said the kingdom of Israel would be exalted because God was on their side. They would defeat their enemies and the Lord would bless those who blessed them. 

- Balak was very angry and told Balaam he would not reward him as he had promised but once again, Balaam reminded the king he was only allowed to speak the words God put in his mouth. 

_BALAAM’S FINAL PROPHETIC DISCOURSE (24:14-25):_  
- Before leaving Balak, Balaam prophesied about the fate of the Midianites, Moabites, and Israelites. He prophesied a star and a scepter would rise out of Israel and they would crush Moab. 

- He went on to announce future judgment on the sons of Sheth, the Edomites, the Amalekites, the Kenites, and the people of Eber. 

- After finishing his message from God, Balaam and Balak parted ways.
