# FACTS

This chapter tells the reader about the Israelites’ travels through Seir, Moab, Ammon, and the land of the Amorites. 

_Wanderings in the Wilderness_
- *Deuteronomy 2 continues Moses’ retelling of the history of Israel from the time they left Egypt to their arrival at the border of Canaan (approximately 40 years). 

- They spent “many days” (38 years; 2:14) in the wilderness before God gave them permission to return to Canaan. 

- God told the Israelites to travel through the land of Seir, but they were not to fight with the people because they were descendants of Jacob’s brother, Esau. 

- After Seir, Moses led the people through the land of the Moabites, but once again, God prohibited Israel from fighting with the inhabitance because they were descendants of Lot, Abraham’s nephew. 

- The Israelites’ crossing of the Zered brook (2:13) marked the end of their wandering in the wilderness. 

- Every person in the older generations died during the 38 years in the wilderness. This was God’s curse for their faithlessness (1:35). 

- God told the Israelites to continue their journey into the land of the Ammonites. They were not to attack the Ammonites because they, like the Moabites, were descendants of Lot. 

- Then, God directed Moses to lead the people into the land of the Amorites, ruled by king Sihon.

- Moses attempted to make peaceful arrangements to travel through Sihon’s land, but God hardened Sihon’s heart, and he refused to let Israel pass.  

- Sihon brought his army out against Israel, but the Lord gave Israel the victory. 

- The Israelites completely destroyed Sihon’s kingdom. Moses said, “we captured all his cities at that time and devoted to destruction every city, men, women, and children” (2:34).
