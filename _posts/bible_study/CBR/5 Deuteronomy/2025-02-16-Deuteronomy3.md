# FACTS
_THE DEFEAT OF KING OG OF BASHAN (3:1-11):_
- Og, the king of Bashan, prepared his army and went to fight with Israel. 

- God told Moses not to fear Og because God intended to give Og’s land to Israel. 

- At the battle, the Israelites defeated all of Og’s men and took possession of his 60 cities. The cities and their inhabitance were destroyed. 

- The text tells us Og was a descendant of the Rephaim, men renown for their height (2:20-21). The dimensions of his bed are mentioned, roughly 13.5 feet long and 6 feet wide (4.1 x 1.8 meters). 

_THE INHERITANCE OF REUBEN, GAD, AND HALF OF MANASSEH (3:12-20):_
- The land the Israelites had conquered east of the Jordan was given the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh. These tribes had specifically requested the land because of their large number of livestock (Num 32:1-5). 

- But Moses required the men of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh to keep their word and help the other tribes conquer the land west of Jordan before settling in their homes (Num 32:20-27).

_MOSES IS PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING CANAAN (3:21-29):_
- Moses encouraged Joshua to remember Israel’s defeat of Sihon and Og and allow it to give him confidence God would aid him as he led the people across the Jordan to fight more battles. 

- Moses knew God had forbidden him from entering Canaan (Num 20:24), but he plead with God to change His mind. God was resolute and would not permit him to enter. 

- He told Moses to ascend the nearby mountain, Mount Pisgah, and look over the land of Canaan from afar.
