# FACTS
_MOSES COMMANDS THE PEOPLE TO KEEP GOD’S LAWS (4:1-14):_
- Moses instructed the Israelites to honor God’s laws as they conquered Canaan and made it their home. 

- He warned them not to add to God’s words or take anything away from them. 

- The Israelites were to cherish God’s law because it was unique among the nations. 

_THE PROHIBITION AND PUNISHMENT FOR IDOLATRY (4:15-28):_
- When God spoke from Mount Sinai and gave Moses the law, He did not appear in a physical form resembling something in the natural world, so the Israelites were not to make figures to represent God or to bow down in worship to any manmade idols. 

- If the Israelites forgot God’s law after making their home in Canaan, God promised to scatter them among the nations and make them the servants of men who worshipped false gods. 

_A PROMISE OF GOD’S FUTURE MERCY (4:29-31):_
- God, speaking through Moses, foretold of a time in the future when the Israelites would disobey him and would lose the land of Canaan. 

- God promised the people, if they would repent and return to Him, He would be merciful to them and keep His covenant with them. 

_ISRAEL’S SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD (4:32-40):_
- Moses did not want the people to forget the privileged position God gave them. No other nation enjoyed the same closeness with God as the Israelites. They heard God’s voice at Sinai and the Lord personally freed them from Egypt with miracles. 

- These things were done to convince the Israelites that their God was the one true god and to impress on them the importance of obeying the Lord’s commands. 

_MOSES ESTABLISHES CITIES OF REFUGE EAST OF JORDAN (4:41-43):_
- Moses appointed Bezer, Ramoth, and Bashan as cities of refuge. 

- These cities offered protection to those who accidently killed another person (Num 35:9-11).

- The final verses of this chapter set the stage for Moses’ speech which begins in chapter 5.
