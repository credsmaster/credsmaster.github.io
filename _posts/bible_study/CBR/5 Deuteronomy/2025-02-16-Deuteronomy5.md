# FACTS
_MOSES RECOUNTS THE 10 COMMANDMENTS GIVEN AT MOUNT SINAI (5:1-33):_  
Moses summoned all the people to him and began reminding them of the events that occurred at Mount Sinai nearly 40 years earlier. 

- God appeared to the people in fire on the mountain and spoke the words of His law. The first part of God’s law was known as the 10 commandments and God wrote the commandments on 2 tablets of stone (5:22). 

_THE 10 COMMANDMENTS:_
1. The Israelites were not to make idols. 
2. They were not to worship other Gods.
3. They were not to take the Lord’s name in vain. 
4. God’s Sabbath day laws were to be kept and respected. 
5. Children were to honor their father and mother. 
6. Murder was prohibited.
7. Adultery was forbidden. 
8. Stealing was outlawed. 
9. The Israelites were not to give false testimony (bear false witness). 
10. The Israelites were not to covet their neighbor’s possessions. 

- After hearing these 10 commandments from the voice of God, the elders of the people were terrified of God’s voice and asked Moses to speak with God privately and share His words with them later. 

- God took Moses up on the mountain and shared the rest of His teaching and commands with him there. 

- When Moses came off the mountain, he taught the people how God wanted them to live and how He would bless them and give them the land of Canaan if they obeyed Him. 

- Here in Deuteronomy 5, Moses reminded the people of this agreement as they were about to enter Canaan and make it their home.
