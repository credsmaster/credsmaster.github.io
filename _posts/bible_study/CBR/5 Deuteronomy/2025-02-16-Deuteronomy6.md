# FACTs
_GOD’S COVENANT WITH ISRAEL (6:1-19):_
- Moses again reminded the Israelites of God’s covenant with them. If they would obey God’s commands, He would bless them, allow them to live in Canaan, and multiply them. 

- Moses insisted the Israelites teach God’s laws to their children so they would not be forgotten, and the blessings lost in future generations. 

- The people were to love God with all their heart, soul, and might. 

- The covenant with God was to be internalized by every Israelites. They were to live as if God’s laws were always on their hearts and before their eyes. 

- Moses warned the people not to forget God when they found homes in Canaan and lived off the blessed land. 

- While in Canaan they were not to worship the false gods of other nations. 

- They were instructed to run all the current inhabitants of Canaan out of the land before they made homes there. This would prevent pagan nations from enticing Israel to worship idols. 

_TEACHING THE NEXT GENERATION OF ISRAELITES (6:20-25):_
- When the Israelite children came to their parents in Canaan and asked them why they insisted on keeping the “testimonies and the statutes and the rules” of God, Moses gave the parents the appropriate response. 

- They were to recount the story of the Exodus to their children and tell them how God saved them from slavery and kept His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to give them the land of Canaan as a home. It was for this reason they worshipped God and obeyed His commands.
