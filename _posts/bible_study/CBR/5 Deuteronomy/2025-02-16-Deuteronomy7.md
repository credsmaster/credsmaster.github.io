# FACTS
Chapter 7 is a continuation of Moses’ speech to the Israelites. 
- Moses commanded the people to cast out all the nations that inhabited Canaan when they entered the land. 

- Moses mentioned several of those nations: Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 

- They were not to allow people of these nations to intermingle with them, be their neighbors, or intermarry with them. 

- They were to tear down all their idols and destroy their pagan holy sites. 

- They were not allowed to take the gold or silver from the idols they destroyed because they were considered an abomination and something to be abhorred (7:25-26). 

- Israel was to be separate from these nations in every way because they were a “holy people to the Lord.” God had selected them for this privileged position, not because they were particularly special compared to other nations, but because of God’s promises to Abraham. 

- Moses reiterated that the Israelites would be blessed with protections, health, fertility, and wealth if they kept God’s commands, but they would be the recipients of God’s punishment if they neglected them. 

- If the Israelites found themselves in doubt of their ability to conquer Canaan, they were to call to mind God’s 10 plagues and the humiliation of Egypt. 

- God promised to empower them until all the kings of Canaan were defeated.
