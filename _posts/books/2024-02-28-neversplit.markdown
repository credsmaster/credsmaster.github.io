### *Life is Negotiation*

The first step in achieving a mastery of daily negotiation is to get over your aversion to negotiating.  

#### Tactics / Techniques

1. Open ended questions/ calibrated questions - queries that the other party can answer but have no fixed answers --> Buys you time and gives the opponent a false idea of control
2. Based on Kahneman's research - 'Thinking, fast and slow', Influencing the subconscious mind(System 1 - fast, instinctive and emotional), gifts you control on the conscious mind (System 2 - the slow, deliberative and logical)
3. A way of seeding more warmth into an interaction(especially a tense situation) - use an apology and mention the name of the other party. i.e 'I am sorry John, but I cannot offer you that'.
4. Taking the sting out

#### Vocabularies

1. Languid (my counterpart was a languid guy) --> unenergetic, slow, relaxed
2. redhead (do not be a redhead) --> could be associated with having red hair or in slang, being a witch.
3. Smiling like the Cheshire cat --> a very wide smile
4. Haggle --> bargain persistently
5. Inchoate --> only recently
6. feet-to-the-fire --> to pressure someone to do something or simply to force someone to comply.
7. Muck up --> to spoil something completely or to do something badly that you fail to achieve what you anticipated.
8. schizophrenia - listening to the voices in the head
9. Quibble - To evade the point of an argument by caviling words
10. Vituperative - verbal abuse i.e sustained and bitter railing and condemnation
11. Renege - To fail to do what you had agreed to do. In other terms, not keping a promise

#### Great Minds Research Nuggets

<u>Getting to Yes principles</u>

1. Separate the person(the emotion) from the problem
2. Don't get wrapped up in the other side's position(what they are asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they are asking for it - know why they want it)
3. Work cooperatively to generate win-win options
4. Establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions

<u>Tversky & Kahneman Research (Thinking, Fast and Slow)</u>

* Framing effect -  demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed
* Prospect theory - explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses
* Loss Aversion - shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain

<u>Psychotherapy research / Techniques</u>

* Listening is the cheapest and yet the most effective concession - it demonstrates empathy and sincere desire to better understand what other side is experiencing
* Tactical Empathy --> Listening as a martial art i.e. balancing the subtle behavior of emotional intelligence and assertive skills of influence

<u>Common Mistakes</u>

* Schizophrenia - the condition where one is listening to the voices in their head
How to deal with it:
    Instead of prioritizing your argument(what to say), make your sole and all-encompassing focus on the other person and what they have to say
* Going too fast - in a negotiation, this risks undermining the rapport and trust.

The Voice

General demeanor and delivery is the easiest and the most immediately effective mode of influence - the voice

* Voice is the most powerful tool in any verbal communication. It can intentionally reach into someone's brain and flip an emotional switch i.e distrusting to trusting, nervous to calm.  
<u> Available voices </u>

* late-night FM DJ voice - this works by inflecting the voice down which shows that you are in control
* Positive/playful voice - this is the most appropriate voice to use
It brings along light and encouraging attitude
Key is to relax and smile while you are talking`
* Direct/assertive voice

<u>Labeling the Pain</u>  
_Good negotiators identify and influence emotions using them as a tool or means_

Tactical empathy - understand the feelings and emotions of the counterpart and hear what is behind those feelings so that you can influence them

Labeling is a way of validating someone's emotions by acknowledging it 
 
* When labeling, avoid using personal propositions such as I. Instead, use a neutral statement i.e 'it seems like you want... 
* After using a label, keep quite and listen - let the magic happen
* The fastest and most efficient way of establishing a working relationship is by acknowledging the negative and diffusing it

`According to research, the best way to deal with negativity is to observe it, without reaction and without judgement. Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate, and solution-based thoughts.`

<u> Clear the Road before advertising the destination </u>

`Amygdala is the part of the brain that generates fear in reaction to threats.
Labelling a fear is very useful in dealing with it

Do an Accusation Audit
`WHen things seems to be falling apart, it is always wise to do an accusation audit and present it to the opponent. Bounce back immediately after presenting the audit on a positive note. For example, I know you think that I did terribly in my duty and that everything seems lost but just to let you know, all the work is complete and the client  is fully onboarded.
 This tactic brings us to a safe zone of empathy
