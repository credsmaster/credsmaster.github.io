### The Feynman Principles

- Never pay for a woman you just met
  - Doing so sub-communicates that you are willing to provide material possessions in exchange for attention, affection, and sexual favors(or generally her)
  - Your intent should be honestly communicated
- Be ungentlemanly towards the woman you are interested in
  - The actions of a nice guy relates to dishonesty and are interpreted as a way to buy affection. i.e. there is incongruence between the thoughts, words and actions.
  - An 'insult' can sub-communicate to a woman that you are not trying to impress her or are emotionally dependent on her validation
- Make your intentions so clear. Ask for what you want
  - Be blatant and crass - this sub-communicates to a woman that you have honest intentions, are unapologetic for your desires, and are congruent between your thoughts, words, and actions

#### Accepting a New Paradigm

_Richard Feynman states: The paradox is only a conflict between reality and your feeling of what reality ought to be.....and it doesn't matter how beautiful you theory is or how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment(facts), it is wrong_

- There is not better time than now to begin paddling yourself out of a downward vortex and into an upward climb
- Have an accurate understanding of how the world operates before being able to excel.

<u>False Paradigms</u>

- Looks, status and wealth alone will bring you quality women - this is heavily propagated because it the most effective form of advertising
  - BUT, what counts? - Confidence, passion and purpose(traits that cannot be purchased but only cultivated through experience)

<u>Facts</u>

1. Attraction is not a choice - while it is possible to act on attraction, you cannot choose to turn off the feeling
2. Becoming better with women is a learnable skillset - experience will always trump pure theory
3. Failing does not equate to failure - you gain muscle by pushing yourself a bit further

#### Healthy Entitlement and Limiting Beliefs
